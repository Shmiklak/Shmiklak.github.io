                                Most of your suggestions seem to be very weak or even helpless. Suggesting small improvements like swapping ncs, adding objects, reducing or increasing spacing, etc, are all important, but if you're aiming to become a nomiantor you will need to take things
                                even further. If some entire section feels off to you, analyze what's causing that and make it into a well explained point. Perhaps they always make use of some odd angle or they're emphasizing the wrong notes, etc. Don't
                                be afraid to point out overarching flaws with maps, as this is a great way to prove your proficiency.
